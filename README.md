_A place for me to gather cool education tech links I find_

* [Predicting success based on programming styles](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-study-shows-success-different-learning-styles-computer-science-class)
"After conducting automated analyses of what students do from moment to moment as they learn to write computer programs, Stanford University researchers were able to predict — with surprising accuracy — the students’ final grades. What makes the feat more remarkable is that the projections were based on learning patterns identified from the students’ work early in the course."

* [A full-stack approach to education] (http://a16z.com/2015/03/13/a16z-podcast-a-full-stack-approach-to-education/)
Despite the name, this is pretty amazing.
"Personalized learning — customized to different student’s interests and levels — has long been an elusive goal of education. Now, however, technology-enabled approaches like AltSchool’s make personalized learning possible at a whole new scale. Yet education has changed very little, fundamentally, in decades. Can a ‘full-stack‘ approach really change things? This episode of the a16z Podcast with AltSchool founder and CEO Max Ventilla and a16z General Partner Lars Dalgaard addresses some of the common myths and misconceptions around tech and education — and shares their hopes for a better platform to engage teachers, students, parents, and entire communities. And not just in San Francisco."

* [Learn SQL on Khan Academy] (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/sql)
Just what it sounds like.

* [Discipline Solutions] (http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/schools-behavior-discipline-collaborative-proactive-solutions-ross-greene)
More edu than tech, but very interesting. A different way of addressing behavior.

* [Exploring Potential for Machine Learning on Dataset about K-12
Teacher Professional Development] (http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2013/HamiltonPlattner-ExploringPotentialforMachineLearningonDatasetaboutk12TeacherProfessionalDevelopment.pdf) 
"Evaluation of k-12 teachers in the United States involves
intense political and philosophical debates.
Data on teacher professional development (PD)
practices is only just emerging in digital form, as
PD management for k-12 moves to online platforms,
and teachers are rated on numerically-scaled
rubrics. Education leaders hope to identify generalizable
factors in PD practices, previous experience,
training, and institutional support that predict
teachers’ improvement. But first we mustdetermine
the viability of currently available data for
predicting teachers’ ratings."

* [A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning] (http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) More tech than edu; this stands out because the visualization in out of this world and to me it feels like a new type of lesson.

* [The Rise of Open Curriculum] (https://medium.com/bright/the-rise-of-open-curriculum-68959f08380d)  "What do personal computers, cell phones, and digital cameras have in common? They all started on the fringes. Then they hit a tipping point and, suddenly, they were everywhere. This past year, I believe “open curriculum” - or curriculum that is free and adaptable - hit a similar tipping point in K-12 education. For the first time, more school districts chose an open curriculum over work developed by traditional publishers, like Pearson."
 
* [Versal] (https://versal.com/) Create interactive online lessons

* [As Coursera Evolves, Colleges Stay On and Investors Buy In] (http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/as-coursera-evolves-colleges-stay-on-and-investors-buy-in/57267)

* [Putting Away the Books to Learn] (https://medium.com/bright/putting-away-the-books-to-learn-77c56d28a7ea) Maker spaces in education - it's currently just for the privileged. Can it expand?

* [anothe maker space article] (http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/education/edlife/forward-tinkering-colleges-make-room-for-maker-spaces.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=photo-spot-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0&referer=https://news.ycombinator.com/)

* [Rx Video Game?] (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-22/project-evo-the-first-prescription-strength-video-game-) A video game created by a neurologist to treat ADHD... but will ADHD kids play video games? haha 

* [Why Virtual Classes Can Be Better than Real Ones] (http://nautil.us/issue/29/scaling/why-virtual-classes-can-be-better-than-real-ones)

* [Probability & Statistics Apps] (http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/apps/index.html) A collection of apps for visualising probability and statistics concepts and experiments, from [this site] (http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/).

* [The Industries of the Future](http://www.amazon.com/The-Industries-Future-Alec-Ross/dp/1476753652) "Leading innovation expert Alec Ross explains what’s next for the world: the advances and stumbling blocks that will emerge in the next ten years, and how we can navigate them." I learned about this from a great a16z, [Open vs. Closed, Alpha Cities, and the Industries of the Future](http://a16z.com/2016/02/19/industries-of-the-future/).

* [Get Ready for the Future](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/get-ready-for-the-future-f4cf7610b985#.f6elepm5r) What's the big deal pushing every kid to code? Is it really necessary? The author argues a firm "yes". He points to the incredible changes in since the early 90s and extrapolates out a decade or two. It is the _value_ tech brings that causes tech skills to be usefull, so I guess the argument is that the value will only increase as the tech gets more impressive. "Already, those who code earn twice as much as those who can't. This is creating an extremely unequal society. Nowhere is this more clear than in San Francisco, where the attraction of monumental technology investment coupled with limited land mass and a social resistance to change has given us a real world glimpse at our possible dystopian future: A world where the technical elite live in close quarters with thousands of formerly middle class citizens forced into abject poverty and homelessness." Lest you think this guy is a tech douchebag, he seems to work hard fighting homelessness in the Bay Area.

* [Optimal Retention in Know-How Tasks](http://experiments.oskarth.com/srspractice/) The author talks about self-teaching, but the work is applicable outside of that.
