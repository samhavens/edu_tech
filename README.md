_A place for me to gather cool education tech links I find_

* [Predicting success based on programming styles](https://ed.stanford.edu/news/stanford-study-shows-success-different-learning-styles-computer-science-class)
"After conducting automated analyses of what students do from moment to moment as they learn to write computer programs, Stanford University researchers were able to predict — with surprising accuracy — the students’ final grades. What makes the feat more remarkable is that the projections were based on learning patterns identified from the students’ work early in the course."

* [A full-stack approach to education] (http://a16z.com/2015/03/13/a16z-podcast-a-full-stack-approach-to-education/)
Despite the name, this is pretty amazing.
"Personalized learning — customized to different student’s interests and levels — has long been an elusive goal of education. Now, however, technology-enabled approaches like AltSchool’s make personalized learning possible at a whole new scale. Yet education has changed very little, fundamentally, in decades. Can a ‘full-stack‘ approach really change things?

This episode of the a16z Podcast with AltSchool founder and CEO Max Ventilla and a16z General Partner Lars Dalgaard addresses some of the common myths and misconceptions around tech and education — and shares their hopes for a better platform to engage teachers, students, parents, and entire communities. And not just in San Francisco."
